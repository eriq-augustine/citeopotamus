ABSTRACT:
Physiological disturbances, including temporary hypoxia, are expected to drive angiogenesis during bone repair. Evidence suggests that the angiogenic ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A plays an important role in this process. We characterized the expression of two receptors that are essential for mediating VEGF signaling, VEGFR1/Flt-1 and VEGFR2/Flk-1/KDR, in a mouse rib fracture model. Their mRNA and protein levels were assessed in four healing phases, which were characterized histologically as hemorrhage formation on postfracture day (PFD) 1, inflammatory response on PFD 3, initiation of callus development on PFD 7, and the presence of a mature callus on PFD 14. Transcript was detected for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as VEGF. While mRNA expression of VEGFR1 was monophasic throughout all healing phases, VEGFR2 showed a biphasic profile with significantly increased mRNA expression during callus formation and maturation. Expression of VEGF mRNA was characterized by a more gradual increase during callus formation. The protein level for VEGFR1 was below detection sensitivity during the initial healing phase. It was then restored to a stable level, detectable through the subsequent healing phases. Hence, the VEGFR1 protein levels partially mirrored the transcript expression profile. In comparison, the protein level of VEGFR2 increased gradually during the healing phases and peaked at callus maturation. This correlated well with the transcriptional expression of VEGFR2. Intact bone from age-matched male mice had considerable protein levels of VEGFR1 and VEGF, but no detectable VEGFR2. Together, these findings uncovered expression signatures of the VEGF-VEGFR axis in endochondral bone repair.
