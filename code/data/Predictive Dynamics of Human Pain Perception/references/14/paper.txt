Psychology of pain.

Abstract:
This article briefly reviews psychological aspects of pain, paying special attention to chronic pain. The review considers the interruptive and interference effects of pain and its impact on a person's identity. The importance of processes related to interruption, interference, and identity will vary across people and the duration of pain. Although brief phasic pain such as that presented in the laboratory will have marked interruptive effects, it is unlikely to produce interference or impact on a person's identity. Acute clinical pain will have both interruptive and interference effects, albeit of a temporary nature, but it is unlikely to have any impact on a person's identity. Chronic persistent pain or frequent recurrent episodic pain, such as headache, may have profound effects on a Person's life. Each of these themes is illustrated with examples drawn from the experimental and clinical literature.
