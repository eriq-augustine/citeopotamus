Abstract:
We assessed immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype responses to variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed on parasite-infected erythrocytes of a panel of heterologous isolates during and after acute episodes in groups of Gabonese children presenting with either mild or severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In the acute and convalescent phases IgG3 and IgG1 anti-VSA antibodies, respectively, predominated. In the absence of infection, the levels of both cytophilic isotypes waned, while those of IgG4 increased, particularly in those admitted with severe malaria. Prospective analyses showed significantly longer delays between malaria attacks associated both (i) with increasing IgG1 responses with specificity for VSA of isolates from children with mild malaria and (ii) with increasing IgG4 responses with specificity for VSA of isolates from children with severe malaria. These findings imply that the predictive value of prospectively measured cross-reactive VSA-specific IgG antibodies with respect to protection against malaria in African children depends both on their isotype and on their fine specificity.
