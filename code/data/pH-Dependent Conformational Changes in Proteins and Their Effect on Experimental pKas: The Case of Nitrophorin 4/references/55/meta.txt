ABSTRACT:
Sodium proton antiporters are essential enzymes that catalyze the exchange of sodium ions for protons across biological membranes. Protonations and deprotonations of individual amino acid residues and of clusters formed by these residues play an important role in activating these enzymes and in the mechanism of transport. We have used multiconformation continuum electrostatics method to investigate the protonation states of residues in the sodium proton exchanger NhaA from Escherichia coli, the structure of which has been determined recently by x-ray crystallography. Our calculations identify four clusters of electrostatically tightly interacting residues as well as long-range interactions between residues required for activation. The importance of many of these residues has been demonstrated by the characterization of site-directed mutants. A number of residues with extreme pKa values, including several of the "pH sensor," can only undergo protonation/deprotonation reactions subsequent to conformational changes. The results of the calculations provide valuable information on the activation of the antiporter and the role of individual amino acid residues, and provide a solid framework for further experiments.
