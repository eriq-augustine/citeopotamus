Abstract:
The past few years have seen the application of confocal and especially two-photon microscopy to the dynamic high-resolution imaging of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells within organs such as lymph nodes and thymus. After summarizing some of the published results obtained to date using these methods, we describe our view of how this technology will develop and be applied in the near future. This includes its extension to a wide variety of non-lymphoid tissues, to the tracking of functional responses in addition to migratory behavior, to the analysis of molecular events previously studied only in vitro, to dissection of the interplay between hematopoietic and stromal elements, to visualization of a wider array of cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, NKT cells and others, and to the interaction of the host with infectious agents. Reaching these goals will depend on a combination of new tools for genetic manipulations, novel fluorescent reporters, enhanced instrumentation, and better surgical techniques for the extended imaging of live animals. The end result will be a new level of understanding of how orchestrated cell movement and interaction contribute to the physiological and pathological activities of the immune system.
