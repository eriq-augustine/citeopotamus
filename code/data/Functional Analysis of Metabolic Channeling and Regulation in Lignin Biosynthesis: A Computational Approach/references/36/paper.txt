Abstract:
To investigate the substrate preferences of O-methyltransferases in the monolignol biosynthetic pathways, caffeoyl and 5-hydroxy coniferyl aldehydes were synthesized by a new procedure involving a Wittig reaction with the corresponding hydroxybenzaldehydes. The same procedure can also be used to synthesize caffeoyl and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohols. Relative O-methyltransferase activities against these substrates were determined using crude extracts and recombinant caffeic acid O-methyltransferase from alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and crude extracts from the model legume Medicago truncatula, tobacco, wheat and tall fescue. Extracts from all these species catalyzed methylation of the various monolignol aldehydes and alcohols more effectively than the corresponding hydroxycinnamic acids.
