Abstract:
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that actively transport molecules across cell membranes. In Escherichia coli they consist primarily of import systems that involve in addition to the ABC transporter itself a substrate binding protein and outer membrane receptors or porins, and a number of transporters with varied functions. Recent crystal structures of a number of ATPase domains, substrate binding proteins, and full-length transporters have given new insight in the molecular basis of transport. Bioinformatics approaches allow an approximate identification of all ABC transporters in E. coli and their relation to other known transporters. Computational approaches involving modeling and simulation are beginning to yield insight into the dynamics of the transporters. We summarize the function of the known ABC transporters in E. coli and mechanistic insights from structural and computational studies.
