ABSTRACT:
The different protein isoforms generated from the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene, an essential regulator of blood vessel formation, differ in biochemical property and functional activity. Despite the relevance of VEGF-A for both normal and pathologic angiogenesis, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA is still in its infancy.
