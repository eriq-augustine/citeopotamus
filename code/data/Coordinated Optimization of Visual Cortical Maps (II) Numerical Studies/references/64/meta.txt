ABSTRACT:
The formation of cortical columns is often conceptualized as a local process in which synaptic microcircuits confined to the volume of the emerging column are established and selectively refined. Many neurons, however, while wiring up locally are simultaneously building macroscopic circuits spanning widely distributed brain regions, such as different cortical areas or the two brain hemispheres. Thus, it is conceivable that interareal interactions shape the local column layout. Here we show that the columnar architectures of different areas of the cat visual cortex in fact develop in a coordinated manner, not adequately described as a local process. This is revealed by comparing the layouts of orientation columns (i) in left/right pairs of brain hemispheres and (ii) in areas V1 and V2 of individual brain hemispheres. Whereas the size of columns varied strongly within all areas considered, columns in different areas were typically closely matched in size if they were mutually connected. During development, we find that such mutually connected columns progressively become better matched in size as the late phase of the critical period unfolds. Our results suggest that one function of critical-period plasticity is to progressively coordinate the functional architectures of different cortical areas--even across hemispheres.
