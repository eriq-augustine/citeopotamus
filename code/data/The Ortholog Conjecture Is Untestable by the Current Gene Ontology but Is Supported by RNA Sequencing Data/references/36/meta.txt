ABSTRACT:
The C. elegans genes ced-2, ced-5, and ced-10, and their mammalian homologs crkII, dock180, and rac1, mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and cell motility. Here, we describe an additional member of this signaling pathway, ced-12, and its mammalian homologs, elmo1 and elmo2. In C. elegans, CED-12 is required for engulfment of dying cells and for cell migrations. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 functionally cooperates with CrkII and Dock180 to promote phagocytosis and cell shape changes. CED-12/ELMO-1 binds directly to CED-5/Dock180; this evolutionarily conserved complex stimulates a Rac-GEF, leading to Rac1 activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These studies identify CED-12/ELMO as an upstream regulator of Rac1 that affects engulfment and cell migration from C. elegans to mammals.
