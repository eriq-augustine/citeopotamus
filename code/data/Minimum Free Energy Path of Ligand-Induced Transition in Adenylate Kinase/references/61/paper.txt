Markovian milestoning with Voronoi tessellations.
Vanden-Eijnden E, Venturoli M
Abstract:
A new milestoning procedure using Voronoi tessellations is proposed. In the new procedure, the edges of Voronoi cells are used as milestones, and the necessary kinetic information about the transitions between the milestones is calculated by running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations restricted to these cells. Like the traditional milestoning technique, the new procedure offers a reduced description of the original dynamics and permits to efficiently compute the various quantities necessary in this description. However, unlike traditional milestoning, the new procedure does not require to reinitialize trajectories from the milestones, and thereby it avoids the approximation made in traditional milestoning that the distribution for reinitialization is the equilibrium one. In this paper we concentrate on Markovian milestoning, which we show to be valid under suitable assumptions, and we explain how to estimate the rate matrix of transitions between the milestones from data collected from the MD trajectories in the Voronoi cells. The rate matrix can then be used to compute mean first passage times between milestones and reaction rates. The procedure is first illustrated on test-case examples in two dimensions and then applied to study the kinetics of protein insertion into a lipid bilayer by means of a coarse-grained model.
