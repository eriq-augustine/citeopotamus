How many maps are there in visual cortex?

Abstract:
In addition to a topographic map of the retina, mammalian visual cortex contains superimposed, orderly periodic maps of features such as orientation, eye dominance, direction of motion and spatial frequency. There is evidence that these maps are overlaid so as to ensure that all combinations of the different parameters are represented as uniformly as possible across visual space. However, it is unknown to what extent geometrical factors limit the number of periodic maps which might simultaneously be present, given this constraint. This paper attempts to investigate the question by using a dimension reduction model to generate maps of simple, many- dimensional feature spaces onto a model two-dimensional cortex. The feature space included a model retina, plus N binary variables, corresponding to parameters such as ocular dominance or spatial frequency. The results suggest that geometrical factors do not sharply limit the ability of the cortex to represent combinations of parameters in spatially superimposed maps of similar periodicity. Considerations of uniform coverage suggest an upper limit of six or seven maps. A higher limit, of about nine or ten, may be imposed by the numbers of neurons (or minicolumns) available to represent each of 2(N) features within a given small region of cortex.
