ABSTRACT:
Detailed understanding of cardiac mechanics depends upon accurate and complete characterization of the three-dimensional properties of both normal and diseased myocardial tissue. This, however, can only be obtained by performing multiaxial tests on cardiac tissue. In this study we subjected thin sheets of passive canine left ventricular myocardium to various combinations of simultaneous biaxial stretching. During each stretch the ratio of the orthogonal strains was kept constant and the corresponding stresses remained proportional. We fitted the biaxial stress-strain data both with exponential strain-energy functions with quadratic powers of strains as well as with an alternative function with nonintegral powers of strains. We used our recently developed nonparametric method to assess the reliability of the coefficients for each of these functions. The quadratic strain-energy functions resulted in wide intra- and interspecimen variability in the coefficients. Moreover, both their absolute and relative values demonstrated marked load history dependence such that interpretation of the direction of anisotropy was difficult. Fitting the data with the alternative nonintegral strain-energy function seemed to alleviate these problems. This alternative strain-energy function may provide more self-consistent results than the more commonly used quadratic strain-energy functions.
