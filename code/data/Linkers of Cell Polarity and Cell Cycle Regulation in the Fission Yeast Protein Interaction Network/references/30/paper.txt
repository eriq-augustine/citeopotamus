Abstract:
In budding yeast, actin disruption prevents nuclear division. This has been explained as activation of a morphogenesis checkpoint monitoring the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. The checkpoint operates through inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc28, the budding yeast Cdc2 homolog. Wild-type Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells also arrest before mitosis after actin depolymerization. Oversized cells, however, enter mitosis uninhibited. We carried out a careful analysis of the kinetics of mitotic initiation after actin disruption in undersized and oversized cells. We show that an inability to reach the mitotic size threshold explains the arrest in smaller cells. Among the regulators that control the level of the inhibitory Cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation, the Cdc25 protein tyrosine phosphatase is required to link cell size monitoring to mitotic control. This represents a novel function of the Cdc25 phosphatase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this cell size-monitoring system fulfills the formal criteria of a cell cycle checkpoint.
