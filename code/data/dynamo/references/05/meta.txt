ABSTRACT:
We identifit three fundamental  requirements for  scalable  network services:  incremental  scalability and  oveflow  growth provisioning,  24x7  availability  through  fault  masking,  and  cost
effectiveness.  We argue  that  clusters  of  commodity  workstations interconnected  by a  high-speed  SAN are  exceptionally well-suited to  meeting  these  challenges  for  Internet-server  workloads,  provided the software infrastructure for  managing partial failures  and administering  a  large  cluster  does  not  have  to be  reinvented for each new service.  To this end, we propose  a general,  layered architecture for  building  cluster-based  scalable  network  services  that encapsulates  the above requirements for  reuse,  and a  service-programming model based on composable workers thatpe$onn  transformation,  aggregation,  caching, i and  customization (TACC)  of Internet  content.  For  both performance  and  implementation simplicity,  the  architecture  and  TACC  programming  model  exploit BASE,  a weaker-than-ACID data semantics that results from  trading consistency for  availability and relying on sof  state for  robustness  in failure  management.,  Our ,qychitecture can  be  used  as  an “off the  shelf  * irtfrastructural platfonn for  creating  new network services,  allowing authors to focus  on the  “content” of the service by composing  TACC building  blocks) rather than its implementation. We discuss two real implemeritations of services based on this architecture:  TranSend,  a  Web distillation proxy  deployed  to the UC  Berkeley  dialup  IP population,  and  HotBot,  the  commercial implementation of the Inktomi search  engine.  We present  detailed measurements of TranSend’s performance  based on substantial client traces,  as  well as  anecdotal  evidence from  the TranSend  and HotBot experience,  to support the claims made for  the architecture.
