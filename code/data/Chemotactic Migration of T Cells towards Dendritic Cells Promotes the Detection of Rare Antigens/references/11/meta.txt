ABSTRACT:
Naive T lymphocytes move efficiently in lymphoid tissues while scanning dendritic cells in search of cognate complexes of peptide in major histocompatibility molecules. However, T cell migration ceases after recognition of cognate antigen. We show here that during the initiation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses, naive CD8(+) polyclonal T cells 'preferentially' interacted in an antigen-independent way with mature dendritic cells competent to present antigen to antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These antigen-independent interactions required expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 on polyclonal T cells and increased the efficiency of the induction of naive, low-precursor-frequency CD8(+) T cell responses. Thus, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells favor the priming of naive CD8(+) T cells by promoting the CCR5-dependent recruitment of polyclonal CD8(+) T cells to mature dendritic cells.
