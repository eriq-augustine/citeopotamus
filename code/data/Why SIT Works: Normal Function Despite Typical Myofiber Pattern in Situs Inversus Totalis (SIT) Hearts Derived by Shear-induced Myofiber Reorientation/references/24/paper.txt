Abstract:
It has been previously shown that the myocardium in the walls of the unloaded passive left ventricle (LV) is not stress free. To assess the functional significance of residual stress in the ventricular wall, we compared the transmural distributions of sarcomere length (SL) in specimens of rat LV myocardium fixed in the unloaded (residually stressed) and stress-free states. When a cross-sectional ring cut from the equatorial region of the freshly arrested rat hearts was cut radially to relieve residual stress, it sprang open into an arc with a mean opening angle of 45 +/- 15 degrees (SD) (n = 8). During immersion fixation in glutaraldehyde, the opening angle increased 9.3 +/- 7.1 degrees (SD) overall. SLs were measured at 16 equally spaced transmural locations from the free wall in the stress-free tissue sections and were compared with control measurements from adjacent cross-sectional rings in which residual stress had not been relieved. Average SL for the stress-free tissue (n = 11) was 1.84 +/- 0.05 (SD) microns and for the unloaded tissue was 1.83 +/- 0.06 (SD) microns. However, analysis of covariance on the pooled data showed that the transmural distributions were significantly different (P < 0.0001). Whereas SL was uniform across the wall in the stress-free state with a mean gradient of -0.014 +/- 0.044 (SD) microns/total wall thickness, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.001) in SL from epicardium to endocardium in the intact unloaded tissue [slope = -0.114 +/- 0.054 (SD) microns/total wall thickness].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
