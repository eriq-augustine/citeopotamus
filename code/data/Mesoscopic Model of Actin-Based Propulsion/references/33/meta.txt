ABSTRACT:
The effects of hydrolysis of ATP-actin to ADP-actin on actin polymerization-based force generation are calculated using a multifilament two-state Brownian ratchet model. The model treats an ensemble of rigid parallel filaments growing against a hard, inert, diffusing obstacle held in an optical trap. The filaments stochastically grow, depolymerize and undergo transitions between polymerizing and depolymerizing tip states. The parameters in the model are obtained from literature values and a fit to the measured dependence of the polymerization rate on the free-actin concentration. For more than two filaments, the stall force per filament near the critical concentration is much less than the equilibrium ATP-actin stall force. By reducing the availability of free monomers, the obstacle causes filament tips to convert to the depolymerizing state, so that only a small fraction of the filaments contact the obstacle at a given time.
