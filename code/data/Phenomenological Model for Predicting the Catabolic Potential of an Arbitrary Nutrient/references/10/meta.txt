ABSTRACT:
Mathematical models which relate the growth rate of a microorganism to a single limiting substrate concentration have long been established. In recent years, it has become apparent that, under certain conditions, the growth rate of an organism may be simultaneously limited by two or more substrates. Mathematical models of double-substrate limitation fall into two categories: interactive and noninteractive models. A discussion of both types of models is presented in both conceptual and mathematical terms. An analogous case of an enzyme which requires two different substrates to produce a single product is presented. This enzyme analog indicates that both types of double-substrate limitation models appear to be feasible under certain conditions. Based upon stoichiometry and specific growth rate-substrate concentration contour plots, a method for determining the operational conditions which will lead to double-substrate limitation is presented.
