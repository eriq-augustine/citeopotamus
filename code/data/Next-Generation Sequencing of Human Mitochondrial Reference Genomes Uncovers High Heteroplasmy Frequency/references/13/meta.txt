ABSTRACT:
A variable combination of developmental delay, retinitis pigmentosa, dementia, seizures, ataxia, proximal neurogenic muscle weakness, and sensory neuropathy occurred in four members of a family and was maternally transmitted. There was no histochemical evidence of mitochondrial myopathy. Blood and muscle from the patients contained two populations of mitochondrial DNA, one of which had a previously unreported restriction site for AvaI. Sequence analysis showed that this was due to a point mutation at nucleotide 8993, resulting in an amino acid change from a highly conserved leucine to arginine in subunit 6 of mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase. There was some correlation between clinical severity and the amount of mutant mitochondrial DNA in the patients; this was present in only small quantities in the blood of healthy elderly relatives in the same maternal line.
