Abstract:
Glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is a scaffold protein composed of seven PDZ (Postsynaptic synaptic density-95/Discs large/Zona occludens-1) domains. The protein plays important roles in the synaptic targeting of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. The interaction between GRIP1 PDZ7 and a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GRASP-1, regulates synaptic distribution of AMPA receptors. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of GRIP1 PDZ7 determined by NMR spectroscopy. GRIP1 PDZ7 contains a closed carboxyl group-binding pocket and a narrow alphaB/betaB-groove that is not likely to bind to classical PDZ ligands. Unexpectedly, GRIP1 PDZ7 contains a large solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface at a site distinct from the conventional ligand-binding alphaB/betaB-groove. NMR titration experiments show that GRIP1 PDZ7 binds to GRASP-1 via this hydrophobic surface. Our data uncover a novel PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction mode that may be responsible for multimerization of other PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins.
