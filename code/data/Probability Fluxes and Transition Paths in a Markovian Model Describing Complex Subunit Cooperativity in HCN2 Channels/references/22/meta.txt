ABSTRACT:
Transition-path theory is a theoretical framework for describing rare events in complex systems. It can also be used as a starting point for developing efficient numerical algorithms for analyzing such rare events. Here we review the basic components of transition-path theory and path-finding algorithms. We also discuss connections with the classical transition-state theory.
