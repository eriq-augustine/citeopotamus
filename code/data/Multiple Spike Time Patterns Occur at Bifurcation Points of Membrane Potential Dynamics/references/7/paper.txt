Abstract:
Hippocampal place cells fire selectively when a rat occupies a particular location. Under certain conditions, the cells briefly represent trajectories along locations away from the rat's current location. New results lend important insight into this phenomenon and demonstrate spatiotemporally coherent, cognitive representations that are independent of current sensory input.
