No ON-OFF maps in supragranular layers of ferret visual cortex.
Chapman B, GÃ¶decke I
Abstract:
Primary visual cortex contains functional maps of a number of stimulus properties including ocular dominance, orientation, direction, color, and spatial frequency. These maps must be organized with respect to each other and to a single continuous retinotopic map of visual space such that each stimulus parameter is represented at each point in space. In the ferret, geniculo-cortical inputs to cortical layer IV are segregated into ON- and OFF-center patches, suggesting the possibility that there might be an additional cortical map in this species. We have used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to search for ON-OFF maps in ferret visual cortical cells and have found none. This suggests that the high degree of ON-OFF segregation seen subcortically in the ferret may play a role in the development of visual cortical receptive fields rather than in adult cortical function.
