ABSTRACT:
A "majority consensus" algorithm which represents a new solution to the update synchronization problem for multiple copy databases is presented. The algorithm embodies distributed control and can function effectively in the presence of communication and database site outages. The correctness of the algorithm is demonstrated and the cost of using it is analyzed. Several examples that illustrate aspects of the algorithm operation are included in the Appendix.
