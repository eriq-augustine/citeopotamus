Abstract:
We reconstruct the physiological parameters that control an avian vocal organ during birdsong production using recorded song. The procedure involves fitting the time dependent parameters of an avian vocal organ model. Computationally, the model is implemented as a dynamical system ruling the behavior of the oscillating labia that modulate the air flow during sound production, together with the equations describing the dynamics of pressure fluctuations in the vocal tract. We tested our procedure for Zebra finch song with, simultaneously recorded physiological parameters: air sac pressure and the electromyographic activity of the left and right ventral syringeal muscles. A comparison of the reconstructed instructions with measured physiological parameters during song shows a high degree of correlation. Integrating the model with reconstructed parameters leads to the synthesis of highly realistic songs.
