ABSTRACT:
Closed-tendon injuries of the hand and wrist are very common in the athletic population. Most of these injuries, if seen acutely, can be treated successfully with nonoperative management, although some do require operative treatment. It is those injuries, however, that go undiagnosed until the end of the season, which may result in permanent disability.
