ABSTRACT:
Recent evidence indicates that aromatizable androgens are more effective than nonaromatizable androgens in restoring normal levels of sexual behavior in castrated male zebra finches (Poephila guttata). To determine whether the efficacy of treatment with aromatizable androgens, is in part due to their conversion to estrogens, castrated male finches were treated with androstenedione (AE), an aromatizable androgen, and their sexual and aggressive behavior was compared with that of castrates treated with AE plus 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD), an aromatization inhibitor. Males treated with AE + ATD showed less courtship activity and less copulatory behavior than AE-treated males, and were unlikely to have nests. Estradiol (E), when given concurrently with AE + ATD, reversed the inhibitory effects of ATD and restored levels of courtship and copulation to those observed in AE-treated males. Only AE- and AE + ATD + E-treated males displayed aggressive behaviors, but the frequency of such behaviors was so low that there were no significant differences across groups. These data affirm the importance of estrogen in the control of reproductive activities in male zebra finches and indicate that aromatization may be an obligatory step for maintaining normal levels of sexual and aggressive behavior.
