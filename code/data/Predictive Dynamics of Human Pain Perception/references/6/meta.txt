ABSTRACT:
The purpose of the present investigation was to find neurophysiological correlates of pain perception. The magnitude and time course of perceived pain was successfully related to the neural discharge evoked by rapid cooling of the tooth surface in 6 dental patients whose lower incisors were to be extracted for prosthodontic reasons. Two cavities were prepared on the facial surface of human lower incisors. The cavities were deepened using hand driven instruments until the pulp was visible through a thin layer of dentin. A metal tube was placed in contact with amalgam on each cavity bottom and fixed in place by composite filling material. The tubes were connected to standard equipment for electrophysiological recordings by a flexible circuit. The magnitude of perceived pain was assessed by a cross-modality matching to finger span in combination with sensory verbal pain descriptors and magnitude estimation. The striking agreement between the integrated nerve activity, probably of the A delta type and pain perception, is of great importance from the methodological point of view since it strongly argues in favor of the appropriateness of the techniques applied here to elucidate the neural substrate of some types of nociception and also to evaluate various means of relieving such pain.
