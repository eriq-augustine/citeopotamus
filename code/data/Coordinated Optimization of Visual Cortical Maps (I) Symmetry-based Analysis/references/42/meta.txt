ABSTRACT:
Theoretical/computational models have played an important role in developing our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in neural map formation. I review models based on both chemospecific and activity-dependent matching of inputs to targets, with a particular focus on map development in the optic tectum and primary visual cortex.
