ABSTRACT:
The passive material properties of myocardium play a major role in diastolic performance of the heart. In particular, the shear behaviour is thought to play an important mechanical role due to the laminar architecture of myocardium. We have previously compared a number of myocardial constitutive relations with the aim to extract their suitability for inverse material parameter estimation. The previous study assumed a homogeneous deformation. In the present study we relaxed the homogeneous assumption by implementing these laws into a finite element environment in order to obtain more realistic measures for the suitability of these laws in both their ability to fit a given set of experimental data, as well as their stability in the finite element environment. In particular, we examined five constitutive laws and compare them on the basis of (i) "goodness of fit": how well they fit a set of six shear deformation tests, (ii) "determinability": how well determined the objective function is at the optimal parameter fit, and (iii) "variability": how well determined the material parameters are over the range of experiments. Furthermore, we compared the FE results with those from the previous study.It was found that the same material law as in the previous study, the orthotropic Fung-type "Costa-Law", was the most suitable for inverse material parameter estimation for myocardium in simple shear.
