ABSTRACT:
Dual nutrient limited growth, the control of the cell growth rate (kinetic aspect) or the restriction of the amount of biomass (stoichiometric aspect) by two nutrients at the same time, is a relatively unknown ability of the microorganisms and consequently, still not mentioned in textbooks to date. Nevertheless, multiple nutrient limited or controlled growth has been reported for different systems; e.g. ecosystems, batch, fed-batch, and chemostat cultures. Generally, dual nutrient limited growth has been observed when the microorganism of interest: (a) showed a variation of the cellular composition, (b) was able to accumulate a storage compound, (c) changed the cell metabolism, or (d) excreted metabolic intermediates. Consequently, stoichiometric models have been developed to estimate the growth conditions leading to dual nutrient limited growth. A general problem of the kinetic aspect is the accurate measurement of the growth controlling nutrients in the culture broth (microg l(-1) range), as the cells may consume residual nutrients during sampling. Nevertheless, most models of dual limited growth deal with the kinetic aspect although the control experiments are difficult to carry out. The aim of this survey is to introduce this special growth feature with respect to basic models, experimental data, and potential applications in bioprocesses.
