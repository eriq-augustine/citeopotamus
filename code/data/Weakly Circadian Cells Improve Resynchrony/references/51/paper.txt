Abstract:
To determine the in vivo regulatory pattern of the clock gene period (per), the authors recently developed transgenic Drosophila carrying a luciferase cDNA fused to the promoter region of per. They have now carried out noninvasive, high time-resolution experiments allowing high-throughput monitoring of circadian bioluminescence rhythms in individual living adults for several days. This immediately solved several problems (resulting directly from individual asynchrony within a population) that have accompanied previous biochemical experiments in which groups of animals were sacrificed at each time point. Furthermore, the authors have developed numerical analysis methods for automatically determining rhythmicity associated with bioluminescence records from single flies. This has revealed some features of per gene transcription that were previously unappreciated and provides a general strategy for the analysis of rhythmic time series in the study of molecular rhythms.
