ABSTRACT:
In this review we describe the state-of-the-art of computer simulation studies of lipid membranes. We focus on collective lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions that trigger deformations of the natural lamellar membrane state, showing that many important biological processes including self-aggregation of membrane components into domains, the formation of non-lamellar phases, and membrane poration and curving, are now amenable to detailed simulation studies.
