ABSTRACT:
Increasing evidence indicates that the transcriptional machinery can influence the efficiency of splicing as well as splice-site selection. Surprisingly, it has now been demonstrated that splicing components influence the efficiency of transcription. This mutual stimulation has important implications for the regulation of gene expression.
