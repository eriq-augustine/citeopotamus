ABSTRACT:
The translocation of DNA helicases on single-stranded DNA and the unwinding of double-stranded DNA are fueled by the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP). Although most helicases use ATP in these processes, the DNA helicase encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 uses dTTP most efficiently. To identify the structural requirements of the NTP, we determined the efficiency of DNA unwinding by T7 helicase using a variety of NTPs and their analogs. The 5-methyl group of thymine was critical for the efficient unwinding of DNA, although the presence of a 3'-ribosyl hydroxyl group partially overcame this requirement. The NTP-binding pocket of the protein was examined by randomly substituting amino acids for several amino acid residues (Thr-320, Arg-504, Tyr-535, and Leu-542) that the crystal structure suggests interact with the nucleotide. Although positions 320 and 542 required aliphatic residues of the appropriate size, an aromatic side chain was necessary at position 535 to stabilize NTP for efficient unwinding. A basic side chain of residue 504 was essential to interact with the 4-carbonyl of the thymine base of dTTP. Replacement of this residue with a small aliphatic residue allowed the accommodation of other NTPs, resulting in the preferential use of dATP and the use of dCTP, a nucleotide not normally used. Results from this study suggest that the NTP must be stabilized by specific interactions within the NTP-binding site of the protein to achieve efficient hydrolysis. These interactions dictate NTP specificity.
