ABSTRACT:
Most studies of eukaryotic gene regulation have been done looking at mature mRNA levels. Nevertheless, the steady-state mRNA level is the result of two opposing factors: transcription rate (TR) and mRNA degradation. Both can be important points to regulate gene expression. Here we show a new method that combines the use of nylon macroarrays and in vivo radioactive labeling of nascent RNA to quantify TRs, mRNA levels, and mRNA stabilities for all the S. cerevisiae genes. We found that during the shift from glucose to galactose, most genes undergo drastic changes in TR and mRNA stability. However, changes in mRNA levels are less pronounced. Some genes, such as those encoding mitochondrial proteins, are coordinately regulated in mRNA stability behaving as decay regulons. These results indicate that, although TR is the main determinant of mRNA abundance in yeast, modulation of mRNA stability is a key factor for gene regulation.
