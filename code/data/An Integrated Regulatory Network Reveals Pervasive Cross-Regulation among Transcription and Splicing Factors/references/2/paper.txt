Coupling and coordination in gene expression processes: a systems biology view.
Komili S, Silver PA
Abstract:
Genome-scale analyses have allowed us to progress beyond studying gene expression at the level of individual components of a given process by providing global information about functional connections between genes, mRNAs and their regulatory proteins. Such analyses have greatly increased our understanding of the interplay between different events in gene regulation and have highlighted previously unappreciated functional connections, including coupling between nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. Genome-wide approaches have also revealed extensive coordination within regulatory levels, such as the organization of transcription factors into regulatory motifs. Overall, these studies enhance our understanding of how the many components of the eukaryotic cell function as a system to allow both coordination and versatility in gene expression.
