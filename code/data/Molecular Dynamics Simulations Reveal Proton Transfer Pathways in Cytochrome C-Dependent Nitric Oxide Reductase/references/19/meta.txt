ABSTRACT:
Respiration of NO resulted in transient proton translocation in anaerobically grown cells of four physiologically diverse denitrifiers. Paracoccus denitrificans, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides subsp. denitrificans, "Achromobacter cycloclastes," and Rhizobium japonicum gave, respectively, H+/NO ratios of 3.65, 4.96, 1.94, and 1.12. Antimycin A completely inhibited NO-dependent proton translocation in P. denitrificans and severely restricted translocation in the R. sphaeroides strain. Proton uptake during NO respiration with antimycin A-inhibited cells supplied with an artificial electron source provided evidence for the periplasmic consumption of protons. Values obtained were consistent with the expected ratios of 0.5 mol of H+/mol of NO for reduction of NO to N2O and 1.0 mol of H+/mol of NO for reduction of NO to N2. These data are consistent with the presence of a unique NO reductase found only in anaerobically grown denitrifying cells.
