Evolution of the protein repertoire.
Chothia C, Gough J, Vogel C, Teichmann SA
Abstract:
Most proteins have been formed by gene duplication, recombination, and divergence. Proteins of known structure can be matched to about 50% of genome sequences, and these data provide a quantitative description and can suggest hypotheses about the origins of these processes.
