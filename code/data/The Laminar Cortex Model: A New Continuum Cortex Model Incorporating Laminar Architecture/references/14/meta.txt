ABSTRACT:
A continuum model of electrocortical activity was applied separately at centimetric and macrocolumnar scales, permitting analysis of interaction between scales. State equations included effects of retrograde action potential propagation in dendritic trees, and kinetics of AMPA, GABA and NMDA receptors. Parameter values were provided from independent physiological and anatomical estimates. Realistic field potentials and pulse rates were obtained, including resonances in the alpha/theta and gamma ranges, 1/f(2) background activity, and autonomous gamma activity. Zero-lag synchrony and travelling waves occurred as complementary aspects of cortical transmission, and lead/lag relations between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations varied systematically around transition to autonomous gamma oscillation. Properties of the simulations can account for generation and control of gamma activity. All factors acting on excitatory/inhibitory balance controlled the onset and offset of gamma oscillation. Autonomous gamma was initiated by focal excitation of excitatory cells, and suppressed by laterally spreading trans-cortical excitation, which acted on both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. Consequently, although spatially extensive non-specific reticular activation tended to suppress autonomous gamma, spatial variation of reticular activation could preferentially select fields of synchrony.
