Kinetics of microbial growth with mixtures of carbon sources.

Abstract:
Several investigations have shown that during growth in carbon-limited chemostats the simultaneous utilisation of carbon substrates which usually provoke diauxie under batch conditions, i.e., 'mixed substrate growth,' is probably the rule under ecologically relevant growth conditions. In contrast, the models presently available for the description of the kinetics of microbial growth are all based on the use of single substrates. Systematic studies in chemostat culture have shown that steady-state residual concentrations of individual compounds were consistently lower during mixed substrate growth than during growth with the single substrates. This effect is clearly demonstrated for the case of Escherichia coli growing with mixtures of glucose plus galactose. The data presented indicate that the extent of reduction of steady-state residual substrate concentration is dependent on the proportions of the substrates in the mixture, the nature of substrates mixed and the regulation pattern of enzymes involved in their breakdown. If this behaviour can be shown to be typical for growth under environmental conditions, it may provide an explanation why microbes still grow relatively fast at the low substrate concentrations encountered in nature.
