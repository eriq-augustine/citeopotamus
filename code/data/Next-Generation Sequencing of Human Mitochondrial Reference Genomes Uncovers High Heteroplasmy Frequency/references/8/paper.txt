Mapping of mitochondrial DNA of individual sheep and goats: rapid evolution in the D loop region.
Upholt WB, Dawid IB
Abstract:
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from sheep and goat was compared by restriction endonuclease analysis and heteroduplex mapping in the electron microscope. The fragment patterns produced by endonuclease Hae III from three individual sheep and two goat mtDNAs all differed from each other. The three sheep mtDNAs had identical Eco RI and Hind III fragments, but the two goat mtDNA patterns differed from each other as well as from sheep mtDNA. We estimate that each sheep mtDNA differs from each other by 0.5-1% of its nucleotide sequences, the two goat mtDNAs by 1-2%, and there is a 6-11% sequence difference between sheep and goat mtDNAs. We have mapped the Eco RI and Hind III sites of goat and sheep mtDNA and determined the positions of the D loop, which marks the replication origin, relative to the restriction map. The D loops are at homologous positions on the mtDNAs from both species, but the goat D loop is only 75% as long as the sheep D loop. Regions with a high degree of sequence divergence occur at both ends of the D loop. We suggest that a duplication of about 150 base pairs has occurred in the region where the sheep and goat D loops differ in length. We discuss mtDNA evolution in terms of divergence of isolated "mitochondrial DNA clones."
