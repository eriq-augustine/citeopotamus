ABSTRACT:
Description of mapping methods using spherical splines, both to interpolate scalp potentials (SPs), and to approximate scalp current densities (SCDs). Compared to a previously published method using thin plate splines, the advantages are a very simple derivation of the SCD approximation, faster computing times, and greater accuracy in areas with few electrodes.
