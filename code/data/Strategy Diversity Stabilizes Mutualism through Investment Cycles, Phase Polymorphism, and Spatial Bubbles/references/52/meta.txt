ABSTRACT:
If arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) promote phosphorus partitioning of plant hosts, they could provide one mechanism for the maintenance of plant community diversity. We investigated whether AMF improved the ability of old field perennials to grow on a range of phosphorus sources and whether AMF facilitated differential performance of plant species on different phosphorus sources (phosphorus niche partitioning). We manipulated form of phosphorus (control versus different inorganic and organic sources) and AM fungal species (control versus four individual AMF species or an AMF community) for five old field perennials grown in a greenhouse in individual culture. Based on biomass after four months of growth, we found no evidence for phosphorus niche partitioning. Rather, we found that effects of AMF varied from parasitic to mutualistic depending on plant species, AMF species, and phosphorus source (significant Plant x Fungus x Phosphorus interaction). Our results suggest that the degree of AMF benefit to a plant host depends not only on AMF species, plant species, and soil phosphorus availability (as has also been found in other work), but can also depend on the form of soil phosphorus. Thus, the position of any AMF species along the mutualism to parasitism continuum may be a complex function of local conditions, and this has implications for understanding plant competitive balance in the field.
