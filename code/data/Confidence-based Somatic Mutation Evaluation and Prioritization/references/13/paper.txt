Abstract:
We report a targeted, cost-effective method to quantify rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms from pooled human genomic DNA using second-generation sequencing. We pooled DNA from 1,111 individuals and targeted four genes to identify rare germline variants. Our base-calling algorithm, SNPSeeker, derived from large deviation theory, detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms present at frequencies below the raw error rate of the sequencing platform.
