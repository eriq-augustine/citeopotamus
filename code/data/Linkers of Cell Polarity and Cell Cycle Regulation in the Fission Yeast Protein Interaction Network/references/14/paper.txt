Abstract:
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphoprotein phosphatase Cdc14p plays a central role in exit from mitosis, by promoting B-type cyclin degradation and allowing accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1p. Cdc14p is sequestered in the nucleolus during interphase, from where it is released at the end of mitosis, dependent upon mitotic exit network function. The CDC14 gene is essential and loss-of-function mutants arrest at the end of mitosis. We have identified a fission yeast orthologue of CDC14 through database searches. A Schizosaccharomyces pombe flp1 (cdc fourteen-like-phosphatase) null mutant is viable, divides at a reduced size and shows defects in septation. flp1p is not the essential effector of the S. pombe septation initiation network, but may potentiate signalling of the onset of septation. In contrast to S. cerevisiae Cdc14p, flp1p is not required for the accumulation or destruction of the B-type cyclin cdc13p, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor rum1p, or for dephosphorylation of the APC/C specificity factor ste9p in G1. Like its budding yeast counterpart, flp1p is restricted to the nucleolus until mitosis, when it is dispersed through the nucleus. In contrast to S. cerevisiae Cdc14p, flp1p is also present on the mitotic spindle and contractile ring. The potential roles of flp1p in cell cycle control are discussed.
