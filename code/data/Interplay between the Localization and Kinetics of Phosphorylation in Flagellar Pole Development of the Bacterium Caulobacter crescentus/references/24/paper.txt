Abstract:
Regulation of polar development and cell division in Caulobacter crescentus relies on the dynamic localization of several proteins to cell poles at specific stages of the cell cycle. The polar organelle development protein, PodJ, is required for the synthesis of the adhesive holdfast and pili. Here we show the cell cycle localization of PodJ and describe a novel role for this protein in controlling the dynamic localization of the developmental regulator PleC. In swarmer cells, a short form of PodJ is localized at the flagellated pole. Upon differentiation of the swarmer cell into a stalked cell, full length PodJ is synthesized and localizes to the pole opposite the stalk. In late predivisional cells, full length PodJ is processed into a short form which remains localized at the flagellar pole after cell division and is degraded during swarmer to stalked cell differentiation. Polar localization of the developmental regulator PleC requires the presence of PodJ. In contrast, the polar localization of PodJ is not dependent on the presence of PleC. These results indicate that PodJ is an important determinant for the localization of a major regulator of cell differentiation. Thus, PodJ acts directly or indirectly to target PleC to the incipient swarmer pole, to establish the cellular asymmetry that leads to the synthesis of holdfasts and pili at their proper subcellular location.
