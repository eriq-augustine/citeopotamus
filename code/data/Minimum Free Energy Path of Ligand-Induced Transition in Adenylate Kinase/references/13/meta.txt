ABSTRACT:
Adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli (AKeco), consisting of a 23.6-kDa polypeptide chain folded into domains CORE, AMPbd, and LID catalyzes the reaction AMP + ATP <--> 2ADP. The domains AMPbd and LID execute large-amplitude movements during catalysis. Backbone dynamics of ligand-free and AP(5)A-inhibitor-bound AKeco is studied with slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) (15)N relaxation, an approach particularly suited when the global (tau(m)) and the local (tau) motions are likely to be coupled. For AKeco tau(m) = 15.1 ns, whereas for AKeco*AP(5)A tau(m) = 11.6 ns. The CORE domain of AKeco features an average squared order parameter, <S(2)>, of 0.84 and correlation times tau(f) = 5-130 ps. Most of the AKeco*AP(5)A backbone features <S(2)> = 0.90 and tau(f) = 33-193 ps. These data are indicative of relative rigidity. Domains AMPbd and LID of AKeco, and loops beta(1)/alpha(1), alpha(2)/alpha(3), alpha(4)/beta(3), alpha(5)/beta(4), and beta(8)/alpha(7) of AKeco*AP(5)A, feature a novel type of protein flexibility consisting of nanosecond peptide plane reorientation about the C(i-1)(alpha)-C(i)(alpha) axis, with correlation time tau(perpendicular) = 5.6-11.3 ns. The other microdynamic parameters underlying this dynamic model include S(2) = 0.13-0.5, tau(parallel) on the ps time scale, and a diffusion tilt beta(MD) ranging from 12 to 21 degrees. For the ligand-free enzyme the tau(perpendicular) mode was shown to represent segmental domain motion, accompanied by conformational exchange contributions R(ex) < or = 4.4 s(-1). Loop alpha(4)/beta(3) and alpha(5)/beta(4) dynamics in AKeco*AP(5)A is related to the "energetic counter-balancing of substrate binding" effect apparently driving kinase catalysis. The other flexible AKeco*AP(5)A loops may relate to domain motion toward product release.
