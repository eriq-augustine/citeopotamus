ABSTRACT:
The current investigation examined the importance of natural killer (NK) cells during the innate immune response to primary influenza infection in young and aged mice. Young (6-8 weeks) and aged (22 months) C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with influenza A virus, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was determined in lung and spleen during the first 4 days of infection. Aged mice demonstrated both a decrease in influenza-inducible NK activity and a reduction in the percentage and number of NK1.1+ cells in response to primary influenza infection, relative to young mice. In order to further establish a role for NK cells in controlling influenza infection, young mice were depleted of NK cells in vivo by injecting rabbit anit-NK1.1 antibody 2 days and 1 day prior to influenza infection. Young mice depleted of NK cells exhibited increased weight loss and lung virus titers during the course of infection, compared to young mice infected with influenza virus. These data indicate that NK cell function is impaired in response to primary influenza infection in aged mice. More importantly, these results underscore the essential role of NK cells in controlling virus titers in lung during the early course of influenza infection, regardless of age.
