Significant impact of protein dispensability on the instantaneous rate of protein evolution.

Abstract:
The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that important proteins evolve more slowly than unimportant ones. High-throughput gene-knockout experiments in model organisms have provided information on the dispensability, and therefore importance, of thousands of proteins in a genome. However, previous studies of the correlation between protein dispensability and evolutionary rate were equivocal, and it has been proposed that the observed correlation is due to the covariation with the level of gene expression or is limited to duplicate genes. We here analyzed the gene dispensability data of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and estimated protein evolutionary rates by comparing S. cerevisiae with nine species of varying degrees of divergence from S. cerevisiae. The correlation between gene dispensability and evolutionary rate, although low, is highly significant, even when the gene expression level is controlled for or when duplicate genes are excluded. Our results thus support the hypothesis of lower evolution rates for more important proteins, a widely used principle in the daily practice of molecular biology. When the evolutionary rate is estimated from closely related species, the ratio between the mean rate of nonessential proteins to that of essential proteins is 1.4. This ratio declines to 1.1 when the evolutionary rate is estimated from distantly related species, suggesting that the importance of a protein may change in evolution, so the dispensability data obtained from a model organism only predicts a short-term rate of protein evolution. A comparison of the fitness contributions of orthologous genes in yeast and nematode supports this conclusion.
