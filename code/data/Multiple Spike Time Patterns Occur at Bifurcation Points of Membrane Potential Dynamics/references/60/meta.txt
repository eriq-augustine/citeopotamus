ABSTRACT:
Neurons in the brain communicate via trains of all-or-none electric events known as spikes. How the brain encodes information using spikes-the neural code-remains elusive. Here the robustness against noise of stimulus-induced neural spike trains is studied in terms of attractors and bifurcations. The dynamics of model neurons converges after a transient onto an attractor yielding a reproducible sequence of spike times. At a bifurcation point the spike times on the attractor change discontinuously when a parameter is varied. Reliability, the stability of the attractor against noise, is reduced when the neuron operates close to a bifurcation point. We determined using analytical spike-time maps the attractor and bifurcation structure of an integrate-and-fire model neuron driven by a periodic or a quasiperiodic piecewise constant current and investigated the stability of attractors against noise. The integrate-and-fire model neuron became mode locked to the periodic current with a rational winding number p/q and produced p spikes per q cycles. There were q attractors. p:q mode-locking regions formed Arnold tongues. In the model, reliability was the highest during 1:1 mode locking when there was only one attractor, as was also observed in recent experiments. The quasiperiodically driven neuron mode locked to either one of the two drive periods, or to a linear combination of both of them. Mode-locking regions were organized in Arnold tongues and reliability was again highest when there was only one attractor. These results show that neuronal reliability in response to the rhythmic drive generated by synchronized networks of neurons is profoundly influenced by the location of the Arnold tongues in parameter space.
