ABSTRACT:
Clp ATPases are ring-shaped AAA+ motors in the degradation pathway that perform critical actions of unfolding and translocating substrate proteins (SPs) through narrow pores to deliver them to peptidase components. These actions are effected by conserved diaphragm-forming loops found in the central channel of the Clp ATPase hexamer. Conformational changes, that take place in the course of repetitive ATP-driven cycles, result in mechanical forces applied by the central channel loops onto the SP. We use coarse-grained simulations to elucidate allostery-driven mechanisms of unfolding and translocation of a tagged four-helix bundle protein by the ClpY ATPase. Unfolding is initiated at the tagged C-terminal region via an obligatory intermediate. The resulting nonnative conformation is competent for translocation, which proceeds on a different time scale than unfolding and involves sharp stepped transitions. Completion of the translocation process requires assistance from the ClpQ peptidase. These mechanisms contrast nonallosteric mechanical unfolding of the SP. In atomic force microscopy experiments, multiple unfolding pathways are available and large mechanical forces are required to unravel the SP relative to those exerted by the central channel loops of ClpY. SP threading through a nonallosteric ClpY nanopore involves simultaneous unfolding and translocation effected by strong pulling forces.
