Combined Hebbian development of geniculocortical and lateral connectivity in a model of primary visual cortex.
Bartsch AP, van Hemmen JL
Abstract:
We present a network model of visual map development in layer 4 of primary visual cortex. Our model comprises excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. The input to the network consists of correlated spike trains to mimick the activity of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). An activity-driven Hebbian learning mechanism governs the development of both the network's lateral connectivity and feedforward projections from LGN to cortex. Plasticity of inhibitory synapses has been included into the model so as to control overall cortical activity. Even without feedforward input, Hebbian modification of the excitatory lateral connections can lead to the development of an intracortical orientation map. We have found that such an intracortical map can guide the development of feedforward connections from LGN to cortical simple cells so that the structure of the final feedforward orientation map is predetermined by the intracortical map. In a scenario in which left- and right-eye geniculocortical inputs develop sequentially one after the other, the resulting maps are therefore very similar, provided the intracortical connectivity remains unaltered. This may explain the outcome of so-called reverse lid-suture experiments, where animals are reared so that both eyes never receive input at the same time, but the orientation maps measured separately for the two eyes are nevertheless nearly identical.
