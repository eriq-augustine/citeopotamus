Wheat cells accumulate a syringyl-rich lignin during the hypersensitive resistance response.

Abstract:
The stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici is an obligately biotrophic pathogen attacking wheat (Triticum aestivum). In compatible host/pathogen-interactions, the fungus participates in the host's metabolism by establishing functional haustoria in the susceptible plant cells. In highly resistant wheat cultivars, fungal attack is stopped by a hypersensitive response of penetrated host cells. This mechanism of programmed cell death of single plant cells is accompanied by the intracellular accumulation of material with UV-fluorescence typical of phenolic compounds. A similar reaction can be induced in healthy wheat leaves by the application of a rust-derived elicitor. We analysed the biochemical composition of this defense-induced phenolic material. Contents of total soluble and cell wall esterified and etherified phenolic acids were determined in rust-inoculated and elicitor-treated leaves of the fully susceptible wheat cultivar Prelude and its highly resistant, near-isogenic line Prelude-Sr5. While no resistance-related changes occured in any of these fractions, the lignin content as determined by the thioglycolic acid and the acetyl bromide methods increased after elicitor treatment. Nitrobenzene oxidation revealed that the entire increase can be explained by an increase in syringyl units only. These biochemical data were confirmed by fluorescence emission spectra analyses which indicated a defense-induced enrichment of syringyl lignin for cell wall samples both from elicitor-treated wheat leaves and single host cells undergoing a hypersensitive response upon fungal penetration.
