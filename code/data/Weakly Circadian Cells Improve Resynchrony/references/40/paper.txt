Abstract:
Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neuroanatomy has been a subject of intense interest since the discovery of the SCN's function as a brain clock and subsequent studies revealing substantial heterogeneity of its component neurons. Understanding the network organization of the SCN has become increasingly relevant in the context of studies showing that its functional circuitry, evident in the spatial and temporal expression of clock genes, can be reorganized by inputs from the internal and external environment. Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for coupling among SCN neurons, relatively little is known of the precise pattern of SCN circuitry. To explore SCN networks, we examine responses of the SCN to various photic conditions, using in vivo and in vitro studies with associated mathematical modeling to study spatiotemporal changes in SCN activity. We find an orderly and reproducible spatiotemporal pattern of oscillatory gene expression in the SCN, which requires the presence of the ventrolateral core region. Without the SCN core region, behavioral rhythmicity is abolished in vivo, whereas low-amplitude rhythmicity can be detected in SCN slices in vitro, but with loss of normal topographic organization. These studies reveal SCN circuit properties required to signal daily time.
