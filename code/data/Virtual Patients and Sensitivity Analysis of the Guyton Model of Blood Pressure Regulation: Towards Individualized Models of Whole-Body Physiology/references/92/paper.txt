Abstract:
Dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-US) is a current functional imaging technique enabling a quantitative assessment of tumor perfusion using raw linear data. DCE-US allows calculating several parameters as slope of wash-in or area under the curve representing, respectively, blood flow or blood volume. Decrease of vascularization can easily be detected in responders after 1 or 2 weeks of anti-angiogenic treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival in RCC or HCC. DCE-US is supported by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa), which is currently studying the technique in metastatic breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cell carcinoma, as well as in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, to establish the optimal perfusion parameters and timing for quantitative anticancer efficacy assessments. Currently 479 patients are included in 19 centers and the preliminary results on 400 patients with 1096 DCE-US demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) quantified at 1 month could be a robust parameter to predict response at 6 months.
