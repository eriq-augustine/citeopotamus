Abstract:
1. Cats were monocularly deprived for 3 mo starting at 8-9 mo, 12 mo, 15 mo, and several years of age. Single cells were recorded in both visual cortexes of each cat, and the ocular dominance and layer determined for each cell. Ocular dominance histograms were then constructed for layers II/III, IV, and V/VI for each group of animals. 2. There was a statistically significant shift in the ocular dominance for cells in layers II/III and V/VI for the animals deprived between 8-9 and 11-12 mo of age. There was a small but not statistically significant shift for cells in layer IV from the animals deprived between 8-9 and 11-12 mo of age, and for cells in layers V/VI from the animals deprived between 15 and 18 mo of age. There was no noticeable shift in ocular dominance for any other layers in any other group of animals. 3. We conclude that the critical period for monocular deprivation is finally over at approximately 1 yr of age for extragranular layers (layers II, III, V, and VI) in visual cortex of the cat.
