ABSTRACT:
We have developed a bioinformatics tool named PAINT that automates the promoter analysis of a given set of genes for the presence of transcription factor binding sites. Based on coincidence of regulatory sites, this tool produces an interaction matrix that represents a candidate transcriptional regulatory network. This tool currently consists of (1) a database of promoter sequences of known or predicted genes in the Ensembl annotated mouse genome database, (2) various modules that can retrieve and process the promoter sequences for binding sites of known transcription factors, and (3) modules for visualization and analysis of the resulting set of candidate network connections. This information provides a substantially pruned list of genes and transcription factors that can be examined in detail in further experimental studies on gene regulation. Also, the candidate network can be incorporated into network identification methods in the form of constraints on feasible structures in order to render the algorithms tractable for large-scale systems. The tool can also produce output in various formats suitable for use in external visualization and analysis software. In this manuscript, PAINT is demonstrated in two case studies involving analysis of differentially regulated genes chosen from two microarray data sets. The first set is from a neuroblastoma N1E-115 cell differentiation experiment, and the second set is from neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells at different time intervals following exposure to neuropeptide angiotensin II. PAINT is available for use as an agent in BioSPICE simulation and analysis framework (www.biospice.org), and can also be accessed via a WWW interface at www.dbi.tju.edu/dbi/tools/paint/.
